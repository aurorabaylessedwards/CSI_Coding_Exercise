# CSI_Coding_Exercise
Finds the nearest tall building to random points as per [G. Berardinelli's instructions](https://gist.github.com/gberardinelli/8567cdbcad220e46b2f8fc4e33a203a0). 

This project is written in Python 3, and requires an up-to-date installation of [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/install.html), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html), and [shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/). If you do not have Python 3, I suggest downloading 64-Bit Python 3.7 [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) with [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows). 

To open the project simply ![open_pycharm](/open_pycharm.png?raw=true =100x100)

Please, reach out if you have any questions to abayless-edwards at QSI. 

Thanks!
